# Layouts

The menu at the top left of the window switches layouts:

- **Player** works like a music player and mixes for you. One bar along the
  bottom of the window shows the track you hear: its album art, title,
  artist, BPM and key (colored by its place on the key wheel, so keys that
  mix have neighboring colors), and what Automix plays next. In the middle
  are **Previous**, **Play/Pause** and **Next** over a thin line through
  the track: white for what has played, and a dim lilac where the next mix
  happens. Point at the line and it turns lilac and shows the time there;
  click or drag to move through the track. The time played and the track's
  length are either side. On the right are the master volume, the mini
  player button, the lyrics button and the queue button, which shows or hides **Up Next**
  (the Automix list), and under them the file's quality: format, bit depth
  and sample rate in lilac for lossless files (**FLAC 16-BIT 44.1 KHZ**),
  or the bitrate in grey (**MP3 320 KBPS**). The **heart** beside the title
  puts the track playing in **Favorites** (a playlist made at the top of
  Playlists the first time), or takes it out; it is filled lilac while the
  track is there. Right-click it to add the track to a crate or playlist,
  or to a new crate.
  Click the album art on the bar for **Now Playing**: the art large over
  the whole library, with the title, artist, album, BPM, key and the file's
  quality under it, and on the right the track's **Lyrics** (large, the line
  sung lit) or its **Details** (album, track number, year, genre, length,
  tempo, key, file, rating, plays, when it was last played and added).
  Up Next stays beside it. The lyrics button opens it on Lyrics; the art
  again, or the ⌄ at the top left, goes back to the library.
  The **mini player** (**⇧⌘M**, **View › Mini Player**, or its button on
  the bar) is a small square window of album art that stays on top of the
  others. Point at it and the art dims and shows the title, artist, a
  progress line (click it to move through the track), **Previous**,
  **Play/Pause** and **Next**; **✕** brings back the main window, which
  hides while the mini player shows. It has no title bar: drag the art to
  move it, and the grip in its bottom right corner to resize it (it stays
  square). **Order** and **Repeat** are at the
  top of Up Next. With Repeat on, a played track goes back to the end of Up
  Next instead of leaving it, so the list keeps going round.
  Up Next shows the track playing on top, under **Now playing**. Each
  mix follows the panel's **Length** and **Style**, unless you pick one
  for a single track: right-click it in Up Next and choose under **Mix
  into it** (**Panel** goes back to the panel's). A row with its own mix
  shows it in lilac, such as **⤵ 32 bars · Cut**.
  Click the artist on the bar, an artist in the search box's results, or
  **Go to Artist** in a track's menu, and their **page** opens over the
  list: their tracks in your collection, most played first, and their
  albums, newest first. Click an album (or **Go to Album**) for its page,
  with its tracks in order. **Play** plays the page now, **Shuffle** in a
  random order, and **Mix** in the order that mixes best by key and
  tempo; clicking a track plays it now (on an album, with the rest after
  it). The arrow at the top left goes back; picking a list closes the page.
  **Keep going**, under them, is Player's cruise control, off at first:
  while it is on, Up Next never runs dry. When fewer than two tracks wait,
  a track that mixes with the last one goes on the list (close on the
  Camelot wheel, close in tempo, not played in the last 3 hours, not the
  same artist twice in a row), and the next three picks show greyed at the
  end of Up Next, so you can drag in something else first. **From** picks
  where they come from: **Everything**, or the list the browser shows.
  Switching it on also switches Automix on. Right-click a track and pick
  **Start Radio** (the track plays next, then picks from everything) or
  **Start Artist Radio** (the artist's tracks and those sharing their
  genres), or right-click a crate or playlist and pick **Start Radio** to
  keep going from it.
  The keyboard's **play/pause**, **next** and **previous** keys, the
  buttons on headphones, and the system's Now Playing (Control Center on
  macOS, the media overlay on Windows, the desktop's media controls on
  Linux) work Player as its buttons do, and show the track with its art.
  The DJ layouts leave them alone unless **Media keys in every layout** is
  on in **Settings › Keyboard**, so a headphone button can't stop a deck
  in the middle of a set.
  The top bar keeps to search. The search box (**⌘F**) is Player's only
  search box: it filters the track list and shows the best matches as you
  type: artists and albums first, then tracks (tracks first when a title is
  the better match). Point at one, or move with **↑** and **↓**, and pick
  **Play next**, **Add to queue** (the end of Up Next) or **Play now**,
  which mixes into it straight away; on an album these take the whole
  album in order, and on an artist **Show tracks** searches for them. The keys are **↵**, **⇧↵** and **⌘↵**; **Esc**
  clears the box and the list's search. There is no MASTER button (the
  bar's volume is the master volume); **REC** shows only while recording
  (start it from **File › Record Mix**), and **MIC** only while the mic is
  on, or when **Show MIC** is ticked in the layout menu.
  Underneath, decks 1 and 2 take turns and [Automix](automix.md) mixes from
  one to the other. **Play** switches Automix on, **Next** mixes into the next
  track straight away, **Previous** goes back to the start of the track, and
  **Order** puts Up Next in order (shuffle, BPM, harmonic and so on). The
  large waveforms and the FX bar are hidden in Player.
- **2-Deck** shows the full decks, with pads and loops, and the mixer between
  them (see [Decks and mixer](decks.md)).
- **4-Deck** shows four decks side by side, in the order 3, 1, 2, 4, as djay Pro
  does. Each deck is a strip with its own EQ, filter, gain and channel fader,
  PLAY and CUE, loop, pads and effects. A bar under the strips holds each
  deck's crossfader side, **SYNC** and tempo, either side of the crossfader;
  click a deck's tempo there for key lock, quantize and a tempo reset. With
  **WAVEFORMS** lit in the top bar, the four large waveforms are stacked above
  the decks in the same order.
  A [Groove Box](groove-box.md) deck shows its step grid only in 2-Deck.

The button at the bottom left of the window hides the decks for a compact
view in 2-Deck and 4-Deck.

<!-- The Prep layout is hidden until v0.6 (PREP_OFFERED in crates/app/src/main.rs).
   Put this section and its line in the list above back with it.

## Prep

Prep shows deck 1 alone, with no mixer, crossfader or effects, and opens the
browser on **In Prep** (see
[Stages](music.md#stages-inbox-in-prep-and-play-ready)). The In Prep list has
its own columns, to see what each track still needs: **Grid** (✓ locked,
✓ edited, ? check when the analysis wasn't sure, the number of tempo
sections, or detected), **Cues** (how many hot cues), **Tags** (✓ with a
genre and at least one of your tags), **Cover**, **Ready** (checklist lines
ticked) and **Score**. Pick other columns from the header's menu as
in any list; In Prep keeps its own set. Load a track and work through it:

- The large waveform shows 8 bars; **−** and **+** above the hot cues show
  more or fewer. While the grid is unlocked, dragging the waveform slides the
  audio under the grid, so you can line the beat lines up with the kicks by
  hand; one drag is one **Undo**. With the grid locked, dragging moves through
  the track as on the other layouts.
- **Beat grid** has the grid tools from the deck's grid menu: **Bar 1 here**,
  **Beat here**, **Tap**, **Click** (a metronome on every beat), move the grid
  earlier or later, tempo **−** and **+**, **½** and **×2**, tempo sections,
  **Undo** and **Detected** (back to the detected grid). **Lock** keeps the
  grid from being changed.
- **CUE** and play, jumps of 1, 4 and 8 bars, a loop, and the deck's
  headphone cue and level.
- Eight hot cue pads with their names and times: click an empty pad to set
  it, a set one to jump there, Shift-click to clear it.
- The side panel's **Cues** tab lists the track's hot cues, memory cues and
  saved loops in track order. Type a name, click the dot for the next color,
  click a time to jump there, or click the number to move the cue to another
  pad (the cue on that pad takes its place) or make it a memory cue.
  **+ Memory cue** (or **C**) adds one at the playhead; while a loop plays it
  saves the loop instead. Outside Prep the tab follows deck 1 or deck 2.
- The side panel's **Checklist** tab lists what makes the track ready. The
  app ticks its own lines when the track has them: **Grid checked** (locked
  or edited), **4 hot cues**, **Genre**, **Rating** and **Cover**; tick one
  by hand when the track is fine without it. Add your own lines, such as
  "Vocals checked", in Settings › Collection › Stages (or **Edit checklist
  lines…** at the bottom of the tab), where you can also turn the app's
  lines off. Tick a line with a click or **Option+1**–**9**. Below the lines,
  give the track your own score from 1 to 10; it shows in the Score column
  and doesn't count towards ready.
- **Play Ready, next** lights up once every line is ticked (the count is
  beside it). It works before that too, for a track that is fine as it is.
  It locks the grid, moves the track to Play Ready and loads
  the next track In Prep. Cmd-Z (Ctrl-Z) takes the stage change back.

A strip under the waveform lists the quick review keys, with how long this
track has taken and your average per track sent to Play Ready from Prep.

Keys in Prep: **Enter** Play Ready, next; **Tab** and **Shift-Tab** next and
previous phrase (8 bars at a time when the track has no phrases); **←** and
**→** four bars; **Option+1**–**9** tick a checklist line; **1**–**8** set or jump to a hot cue
(Shift clears it); **B** Bar 1 here; **T** tap; **M** the click; **[** and **]**
move the grid; **−** and **=** tempo; **L** lock; **C** memory cue. Space plays and pauses, as
everywhere.

## Crossfader assignment

In 4-Deck, each deck says which side of the crossfader it is on: **LEFT**,
**RIGHT** or **THRU** (not affected by the crossfader). Decks 1 and 3 start on
the left, 2 and 4 on the right. Click the label to change it.

## Decks 3 and 4 on a two-deck controller

A controller with two decks, such as the DDJ-FLX4, plays decks 1 and 2. In
4-Deck, click deck 3's number to move the controller's left side to deck 3,
and deck 1's number to move it back; deck 4's and deck 2's numbers do the same
for the right side. The number of each deck the controller plays is lit.
Switching to another layout moves both sides back to decks 1 and 2.

Automix always mixes between decks 1 and 2.
