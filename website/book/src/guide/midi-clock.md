# MIDI clock

MIDI clock plays drum machines, grooveboxes, synths with arpeggiators and
other apps in time with your mix. Most hardware follows MIDI clock rather than
[Ableton Link](link.md).

## Pick where the clock goes

Open **Settings › Controllers** and find **MIDI Clock** at the bottom.

1. Press **+** beside **Add output** and pick the MIDI output your gear is on
   (a MIDI interface, or the gear itself over USB).
2. To reach another app on the same computer, pick **openDJ Clock (other
   apps)** (macOS and Linux) and choose *openDJ Clock* as the MIDI clock input
   in that app.
3. Add as many outputs as you like. × takes one away.

If the gear plays a little early or late against the music, move its
**Offset**: + when it plays early, − when it plays late, up to 50 ms either way.

## Turn it on

Open the **MASTER** button in the top bar and turn on **MIDI Clock**. CLOCK
shows on the MASTER button while it's on.

The clock follows the master deck, the same deck Link follows: the deck that's
playing, or the one started first while both play. It runs at that deck's
tempo, 24 pulses a beat, and stays on its beat.

- When the master deck starts, the clock sends **Start** on its next downbeat,
  so pattern-based gear begins on bar 1 with the music. Cue to a bar and press
  PLAY to start them together.
- If the gear loses the bar (you jumped in the track, or the other deck took
  over), press **RESTART ON BAR**: the gear starts again on the master deck's
  next downbeat, without stopping before.
- When the decks stop, the clock sends **Stop** and carries on at the last
  tempo, so the gear keeps showing it. To keep the gear playing instead, turn
  on **Keep running when the decks stop** in Settings › Controllers.

On Windows only one app at a time can open a MIDI output, so close other apps
using it first.

## Let a drum machine or Link lead

The decks can follow the gear instead of leading it.

1. In **Settings › Controllers › MIDI Clock**, pick the gear's MIDI output as
   the **Clock input**.
2. In the **MASTER** panel, set **SYNC follows** to **Clock**. The tempo
   coming in shows under it.
3. Turn on **SYNC** on the decks that should follow.

Synced decks play at the clock's tempo. Once the gear has sent Start they land
on the same beat of its bar, so your downbeats fall on its bar 1. A jittery
hardware clock is smoothed, so the decks don't wobble with it; a real tempo
change is followed within two beats.

To follow another app or a live act in an Ableton Link session instead, set
**SYNC follows** to **Link** (this turns Link on). openDJ then joins the
session's tempo and bars rather than leading it. **Deck** goes back to the
decks leading, as usual.

While the decks follow Link or a clock, MIDI clock out passes on that tempo.
