# Effects

openDJ has four kinds of effects:

- **Deck effects**: three on each deck, in the FX bar.
- **Beat FX**: one effect for the main mix or a deck, under the mixer.
- **Color FX**: one on each channel's filter knob.
- **Pad FX**: played from the pads while you hold them.

All of them follow the tempo of the track, so echoes and gates stay on the
beat. Gates, flangers, phasers, the chorus and rolls also lock to the track's
beat grid: a gate opens on the beat, and a roll starts on it.

## The FX bar

The **FX** button in the top bar, beside **WAVEFORMS**, shows or hides the
FX bar. It runs the width of the window, under the decks and above the
browser: each deck's three effects across that deck's width, and the Beat
FX in the middle, under the mixer.

Each effect has:

- **Its name.** Click it for the list of effects, or step through them with
  the arrows either side.
- **ON** to switch it on and off.
- **Its length in beats**, with ◀ and ▶ to halve and double it. Effects
  that have no length show a slider instead, for their main setting:
  reverb's decay, the filter's resonance, the bitcrusher's bit depth, the
  noise's sweep, the drive's tone, the ladder's resonance, the hall's decay.
- **D/W**, how much of the effect you hear over the dry track.

A deck's effects start as **Reverb**, **Echo** and **Gate**. They play one
after another, so you can stack them.

In 4-Deck each deck's three effects are stacked in three short rows under
that deck.

### The effects

| Effect | What it does |
|---|---|
| Echo | Repeats the sound on the beat, fading out |
| Reverb | Puts the sound in a room or a hall |
| Filter | Low-pass and high-pass, with resonance |
| Flanger | A sweeping jet sound |
| Bitcrusher | Lo-fi: fewer bits and a lower sample rate |
| Phaser | A softer sweep than the flanger |
| Gate | Cuts the sound in and out on the beat |
| Roll | Repeats a short slice, for a stutter |
| Echo Out | Lets the track go, leaving its echo |
| Brake | Slows the track to a stop, like a turntable |
| Noise | A white noise sweep, for build-ups |
| Spiral | An echo that rises in pitch |
| Drive | Warm overdrive, from a little grit to full crunch |
| Chorus | Thickens the sound with slowly drifting copies, wide in stereo |
| Ladder | A resonant analogue-style low-pass that closes as you turn it up |
| Hall | A big, smooth concert hall, with pre-delay |
| Rev Roll | Repeats a short slice backwards |
| Filter Echo | An echo whose repeats get thinner (or darker) |

Switching an effect off fades it out quickly. On a DDJ-FLX4,
**SHIFT** + **BEAT FX ON/OFF** releases the Beat FX instead: it stops
taking in the track, and its echo or reverb rings out for a few beats.

## Beat FX

The **BEAT FX** cell under the mixer is one effect on its own. Pick it by
name, choose where it plays with **1**, **2** or **1&2** (deck 1, deck 2 or
both), then use **ON**, its beats and **D/W** as on a deck effect. On a
DDJ-FLX4 the BEAT FX section of the controller plays it.

## Color FX

Each channel's filter knob plays a **Color FX**. The small **▾** beside the
knob picks which. Each deck keeps its own. The knob does nothing in the
middle and more the further you turn it either way.

- **Filter**: a low-pass to the left, a high-pass to the right.
- **Space** and **Dub Echo**: the same filter, gentler, sent into a reverb
  or an echo on the beat. The tail rings on for a few seconds after the knob
  is back in the middle.
- **Noise**: adds filtered white noise.
- **Crush**: lowers the bit depth and sample rate.

On a DDJ-FLX4, **SHIFT** + **SMART CFX** steps through the Color FX.

## Pad FX

The **PAD FX 1** and **PAD FX 2** pad pages play an effect while you hold
the pad, and stop it when you let go: quick throws without touching the FX
bar. See [Pads](pads.md) for how to open them.

| PAD FX 1 | PAD FX 2 |
|---|---|
| Echo | Roll |
| Reverb | Gate |
| Low pass | Echo Out |
| High pass | Brake |
| Flanger | Noise |
| Phaser | Spiral |
| Crush | Gate Fast |
| Echo Max | Reverb Max |

## When you load a track

Loading a track switches its deck's effects off, so the last track's echo
doesn't carry over. Their beats and dry/wet stay as you set them. Turn this
off in **Settings › Decks** under **Auto reset on load** (see
[Decks and mixer](decks.md#auto-reset-on-load)).

## Plugins

openDJ runs CLAP and VST3 plugins, and Audio Units on a Mac. Nothing is
loaded until you ask:

1. Open **Settings › Plugins**, check the folders on the **Folders** tab
   and press **Scan**. Each file is opened once in a separate helper, a few
   at a time, so a broken plugin only fails its own row.
2. On the **Effects** tab, tick the effects you want. Plugins are grouped by
   maker: tick a maker to take all of theirs, or open it with the arrow.
   The **CLAP**, **VST3** and **AU** chips narrow the list to those formats
   (none lit shows all), and the search box finds a plugin or a maker.
   Only ticked effects show in the effect lists,
   under a line after the built-in effects, in every slot: decks, Beat FX,
   Mic and Aux. A plugin's first four settings follow the slot's
   parameter knobs.

### The plugin's own window

When a slot plays a plugin, an **EDIT** button shows beside its **ON**
(in the FX bar, the Beat FX and the Mic FX). Press it to open the plugin's
own window, with its presets and every setting; press it again, or close
the window, to put it away. The window floats above openDJ and is titled
after the plugin and where it plays, for example "Pro-Q 3 · Deck 1 · FX 1".
Closing it leaves the plugin playing.

When an FX unit plays on more than one deck, each deck has its own copy of
the plugin and **EDIT** opens the first one's window. Changes made in the
window last while the plugin stays loaded; openDJ doesn't keep them when it
restarts the plugin or quits yet. On Linux the windows need X11 (XWayland
on a Wayland desktop).

Each plugin runs in its own helper process. If it crashes, openDJ restarts
it once with the slot switched off; if it crashes again, or keeps the
audio waiting, it is switched off and a message says so. The music keeps
playing either way.

### Instruments

Tick an instrument on the **Instruments** tab of **Settings › Plugins**,
then click **Jam** in the rail and drag it from the list onto a deck (see
[Jam on a deck](decks.md#jam-on-a-deck)). It plays through that deck's
channel, with its EQ, filter, effects and fader.

The deck's header shows the plugin's format (**CLAP**, **VST3** or **AU**)
and its preset, with **‹** and **›** to step through the instrument's
presets in the order the browser lists them. **SAVE** has **Save**, **Save
as new…**, **Rename…** and **Tags…**, which sets what the preset is and how
it sounds for the browser's chips. openDJ keeps the plugin's state, so the
sound comes back next time. Right-click the cover to choose an image for
the instrument, or drop one on the deck.

In 2-Deck the deck shows:

- A scope of what the instrument plays, and its level.
- **TRIM** and **PAN**. A safety limiter keeps the deck from clipping
  whatever the trim.
- Eight knobs for the plugin's settings. When it has more than eight, the
  page buttons **1** to **4** beside them show the next ones. Right-click a
  knob to pick the setting it turns; **The plugin's own choice** puts it
  back.
- **OPEN**, which opens the plugin's own window for every setting.
- **KEYS ON PADS**, which makes the decks' **KEYBOARD** pads, on screen and
  on your controller, play the instrument instead of the deck's hot cue (see
  [Keyboard and key shift](pads.md#keyboard-and-key-shift)).
- A row under them with **Scale**, **Chord**, **Arp**, **OCT −** and **+**,
  and a keyboard that lights the notes held.

A 4-Deck strip shows the scope, **OPEN**, the first four knobs and
**TRIM**, with the preset in its header.

**Scale** moves each note you play to the nearest note of a scale, so
every key sounds in key with the mix. **Off** plays notes as they are.
**Auto** takes the master deck's key. Or pick a root (C to B) and **Major**,
**Minor**, **Major pentatonic** or **Minor pentatonic**. The keyboard on the
deck marks the scale's keys and dims the rest.

**Chord** plays a chord built on the scale from each key: **Triad**,
**Seventh**, or **Power** (root, fifth and octave). For a chord of your
own, choose **Learn a chord**, hold its keys and let go; **Mine** then
plays it from any key. **Off** plays one note per key.

**Arp** plays the notes you hold one at a time, on the mix's beat. Pick
**Up**, **Down**, **Up and down**, **Random** or **Order played** to turn it
on (**Arpeggiator on** turns it off and on), then
**RATE** (1/4 to 1/32, with triplets), **GATE** (how long each note
sounds, 25% to 100%) and **OCTAVES** (1 to 4). **Hold** keeps it playing
after you let go, until you play new keys. It plays the chords from
**Chord** too.

**OCT −** and **+** move the **KEYBOARD** pads up or down an octave, three
at most each way. The pads play the white keys from middle C.

Any MIDI keyboard without a mapping plays the instrument. The keyboard
button in the deck's header picks which one (**Any keyboard** or one by
name) and which **CHANNEL** (**Any channel** or 1 to 16), and shows which
keyboard played it last. See
[MIDI keyboards](controllers.md#midi-keyboards-and-decks) for which
devices play instruments and which deck each one plays.
