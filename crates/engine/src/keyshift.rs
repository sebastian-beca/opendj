//! Key lock and key shifting: playing a deck at any speed and in any key,
//! as Mixxx does with its RubberBand scaler. Here the time-stretcher is
//! Signalsmith Stretch.
//!
//! The deck's play position stays the position being heard. The stretcher
//! needs input ahead of that (its latency), so its read position runs ahead
//! by a fixed amount and is re-seeded whenever the deck jumps, with a short
//! crossfade from the audio that would have played on.
//!
//! The stretcher splits each block's FFT work evenly over the 30 ms until
//! the next one, so key-locked decks cost about the same in every audio
//! buffer instead of spiking in the buffer where a block starts.
