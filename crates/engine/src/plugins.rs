//! The plugin host: starts a helper process for every effect slot that has a
//! plugin loaded on a target its unit is routed to, attaches it to the audio
//! thread, and watches it.
//!
//! The audio thread never waits for a plugin (see `opendj-plugin-host`): a
//! block the helper can't deliver in time plays dry. This thread decides what
//! happens next. A helper that crashes, or misses too many blocks in a row,
//! is restarted once with its slot switched off; the second time, or when it
//! keeps using too much of the block's time, the plugin is switched off for
//! the rest of the session and its slots are emptied. Nothing turns back on
//! by itself in the middle of a set.
