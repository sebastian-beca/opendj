//! The Groove Box: a deck that plays a drum kit in a 16-step pattern, in
//! time with the mix, instead of a track.
//!
//! `[GrooveN],enabled` turns deck N into a Groove Box. Its sound goes into
//! the deck's channel where a track's would, so EQ, filter, fader,
//! crossfader, effects and headphone cue work as on any deck, and
//! `[ChannelN],play` starts and stops it.
//!
//! **Clock.** The groove keeps its own beat count and follows, in order:
//! the leading deck while it plays, Ableton Link's session while Link is
//! on, or its own tempo (`[GrooveN],bpm`). It never copies the leader's
//! position; it bends its speed toward the leader's beat a little each
//! buffer, as sync does, and when it is more than a quarter of a beat off
//! (a hot cue or beat jump on the leader) it jumps to the leader's beat at
//! its next bar line, never mid-bar. Started while a leader plays, it waits
//! for the leader's next downbeat.
//!
//! **Steps.** Step k (of 16 to a bar) falls on beat k/4, every second one
//! late by `swing`. Each buffer covers beats `[b0, b0 + frames × step)`;
//! every step inside it starts its sounds on the frame it falls on, so the
//! timing is exact to the sample whatever the buffer size.
//!
//! **Patterns.** Four grooves (A to D), each eight rows (tracks) of 16 steps, kept in
//! `[GrooveN],patternG_rowR` as 16-bit numbers (bit s on = step s+1 plays)
//! with `patternG_rowR_soft` and `patternG_rowR_accent` marking the steps
//! that play softly (half as loud) or accented (a quarter louder), and
//! `patternG_rowR_maybe` the ones that play only half the time. `vary`
//! (0-1) lets the groove change by itself as it plays: weak hits drop out,
//! soft ghost notes come in where the genre puts them, and hits waver in
//! loudness (see [`crate::groove_dice`]).
//! `[GrooveN],groove` picks the one playing (0-3); a change while playing
//! waits for the next bar. Row N plays the kits' Nth sound
//! ([`kits::ROLES`]: kick, snare, closed hat, open hat, clap, rim, cowbell)
//! unless `rowR_sound` picks another; row 8, Cymbal, plays the crash or the
//! ride, whichever the groove loaded last uses (no library groove has both).
//!
//! **Library.** `genre` and `pattern` (1-based, 0 none) name a groove of
//! the library ([`crate::patterns`]); `load` puts it into the groove picked.
//! `chain` (1-based, 0 off) names a second groove of the same genre;
//! `load_chain` puts it into the groove after the one picked (A's partner
//! is B, C's is D), and while `chain` is on the two take turns, a bar
//! each. `groove_playing` is the one sounding now. Each row has `rowR_mute`,
//! `rowR_solo`, `rowR_level` (0-1.5), `rowR_pitch` (−12 to +12 semitones)
//! and `rowR_decay` (0-1, 1 = the sound's own length), `rowR_tone` (−1 to
//! 1: left a low-pass, right a high-pass, centre off) and `rowR_pan` (−1
//! left to 1 right), and `rowR_sound` picks which of the kit's sounds the
//! row plays; `rowR_preview` plays it once, now, and `rowR_meter` (0-1)
//! shows how loud the row sounds, for the screen. `[GrooveN],kit` picks the
//! kit. `[GrooveN],position` is the step playing (0-15), −1 when stopped.
//!
//! **Fills.** `auto_fill` (1 or 2) plays a fill at the end of every 4th,
//! 8th and 16th bar (or 2nd, 4th, 8th), `fill` held plays one now, and
//! `remix` (a strip, 0 off) plays one of 16 figures while held; see
//! [`crate::groove_fills`]. `fill_playing` shows when one sounds.
//!
//! **Duck.** With `[GrooveN],duck_deck` set to another deck (1-4), that
//! deck dips by `duck_amount` (dB) on each step of row 1 and recovers over
//! about a step.
//!
//! Kits are synthesised when the engine starts (see [`crate::kits`]); every
//! buffer only reads them, and nothing allocates or frees here.
