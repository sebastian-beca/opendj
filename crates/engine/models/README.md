# Key detection network

`keynet.bin` holds the weights of the neural key detector (`src/keynet.rs`):
the `openkeyscan3.pt` checkpoint of openkeyscan-analyzer
(https://github.com/rekordcloud/openkeyscan-analyzer, commit d5cac64), which
builds on MusicalKeyCNN (https://github.com/a1ex90/MusicalKeyCNN). It was
converted with `scripts/export-keynet.py`: batch norms folded into the
convolutions, weights stored as 16-bit floats.

The network is KeyNet from F. Korzeniowski and G. Widmer, "Genre-Agnostic Key
Classification With Convolutional Neural Networks", ISMIR 2018.

The weights come under the MIT licence below, which lets them be used in
openDJ's GPL code as long as this notice stays with them.
