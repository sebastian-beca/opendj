//! The settings window: builds the rows of each page from what is set now,
//! applies changes to the engine's controls at once and keeps them in
//! settings.json. Saved choices are applied again at start.
//!
//! Each section's rows and its own buttons live in `prefs/<section>.rs`, so
//! a new setting in one section touches only that file. The rest of a
//! section, still here, moves out as it's next changed.
