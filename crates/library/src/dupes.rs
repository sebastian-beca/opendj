//! Duplicates: the same track in the library more than once, grouped by
//! what tells the copies apart, so the easy cases can be fixed in one go.
//!
//! Copies are tracks with the same artist, title and remix (ignoring case,
//! punctuation and "Original Mix"). Those within a few seconds of each
//! other are the same recording, and one of them is kept: the one in the
//! Collection folder, then a lossless file over a lossy one, then the
//! higher bitrate, then the one with cues or a grid, then the most plays.
//! Copies of different lengths are versions (an edit and an extended mix),
//! which the DJ looks at before anything happens.
//!
//! Merging moves everything the other copies had onto the one kept (their
//! lists, history, cues, plays, rating and any tags it lacks), takes them
//! out of the library, and moves their files to a quarantine folder,
//! which only the DJ empties.
