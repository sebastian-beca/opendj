//! Plugins extend the app at a few fixed points:
//!
//! - [`StoreSearch`]: search a store and send the DJ to its page to buy a
//!   track (or, for a download add-on, fetch it into the inbox). No plugin
//!   ever takes payment or plays audio.
//! - [`InboxHint`]: recognise files from a store when they land in the
//!   purchase inbox (see [`inbox`]).
//! - [`LibraryImport`]: bring in the library of another DJ app at start
//!   ([`importers`]).
//! - [`source::SearchSource`]: a source of its own in the rail, with saved
//!   searches and downloads, for an add-on that fetches files.
//! - [`Plugin::settings`]: a page of its own in Settings, for a sign-in or
//!   anything else the DJ fills in once.
//!
//! Plugins are compiled in ([`builtin`]) or are add-on programs of their own
//! ([`remote`]); each runs on a thread of its own in the app, so a slow
//! store never holds up the UI or the audio.
