//! GPU waveform rendering.
//!
//! Each [`WaveformView`] owns a texture. Every frame, [`WaveformView::render`]
//! draws the waveform into it with a fragment shader; the UI shows the same
//! texture as an image, so pixels never leave the GPU. A track's summary
//! (band peaks and RMS, at full resolution and at every coarser level) is
//! uploaded once as a [`GpuTrack`] that a deck's views share; per frame only
//! a small uniform block changes.
//!
//! This follows the approach of Mixxx's `allshader` renderers
//! (`src/waveform/renderers/allshader`), on wgpu instead of OpenGL.
