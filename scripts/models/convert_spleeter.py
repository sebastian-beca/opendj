"""Converts Deezer's Spleeter 4-stem checkpoint to the safetensors file openDJ loads.

    curl -LO https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases/download/v1.4.0/4stems.tar.gz

    python3 convert_spleeter.py 4stems/model spleeter-4stems.safetensors

The weights are Deezer's (MIT). Each stem has its own U-Net; tensors are named
`<stem>.<layer>.<param>` and laid out for burn (NCHW): convolutions as
[out, in, kh, kw], transposed convolutions as [in, out, kh, kw]. Batch norms
are folded to a per-channel `scale` and `shift` (Keras epsilon 1e-3). Stored
as fp16 to halve the download.
