## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phrase bands
Each deck's overview SHALL show, from top to bottom and without overlapping, the waveform, a dot at every minute and a phrase bar with one colour per kind (intro and outro #245A78, build #9472D5, drop #CA4B68, chorus #48C5A1, break #E99B68) and no text. The large scrolling waveforms SHALL flag each phrase start with a line in the phrase's colour and a tab naming it under the bar numbers, and nothing between flags; where a waveform is too short for tabs (4-Deck), only the lines. A live deck's scrolling waveform SHALL show the leading deck's phrases, moved onto its beats, as flags and a thin strip along its top. Right-clicking an overview SHALL offer Show phrases / Hide phrases for all overviews, and right-clicking a scrolling waveform the same for all flags, each remembered between runs. The deck SHALL show the current phrase and the bars left in it.

#### Scenario: Bands
- **WHEN** a track with phrases loads
- **THEN** the overview shows its phrases as bands

#### Scenario: Hidden
- **WHEN** the DJ right-clicks a deck's overview and picks Hide phrases
- **THEN** no overview shows phrase bars, also after a restart, and the waveform takes their room

#### Scenario: Flags
- **WHEN** a drop starts within the view of a deck's scrolling waveform
- **THEN** a rose line marks its first bar with a DROP tab under the bar numbers

#### Scenario: Live deck
- **WHEN** a live deck plays while a track with phrases leads the mix
- **THEN** its scrolling waveform shows the track's phrases on the shared beats, the coming ones ahead of the play line

#### Scenario: Flags hidden
- **WHEN** the DJ right-clicks a scrolling waveform and picks Hide phrases
- **THEN** no scrolling waveform shows flags, also after a restart, while the overviews keep their phrase bars

#### Scenario: Countdown
- **WHEN** a deck plays 8 bars before the end of a Drop
- **THEN** the deck shows "Drop · 8 bars left"
