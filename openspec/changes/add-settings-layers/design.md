# Design

How each candidate setting was sorted. The source list is VirtualDJ's Options & Tweaks (about 330 options,
virtualdj.com/manuals/virtualdj/appendix/optionslist.html); the layer rules come from what Mixxx, rekordbox, Serato,
Traktor and djay Pro do well and badly.

## Rules

1. **Only choices are settings.** VirtualDJ's list mixes four kinds of thing: real behaviour choices (about half),
   window and panel state (sizes, columns, last folder, zoom), the DJ's own content stored as text (custom buttons,
   quick filters, FX lists, pad pages) and bookkeeping (tips seen, dialogs hidden). In openDJ state is remembered
   quietly and reset with View › Reset layout; content is edited where it lives; bookkeeping is hidden behind Help ›
   Show all hints again. Only choices reach Settings or Advanced.
2. **No per-deck rows.** A per-deck choice is a button on the deck (Q, key lock, slip); Settings picks what it starts as.
3. **One home per option.** Each option is one row in one table (key, page, name, description, search words, default).
   Pages show their layer-2 rows; Advanced shows every row; Show modified filters either by "differs from default".
   That list is also exactly what a profile will save later.

## What the other apps do well

- **djay Pro**: very few settings, big toggles, everything applies at once. Most behaviour (auto gain, sync, key lock) is a
  button on the deck, not a preference.
- **Mixxx**: a Decks page holding all load and playback behaviour in one place: cue mode, where a track loads (main cue,
  intro start, first sound, beginning), tempo reset on load, key lock mode, speed range.
- **rekordbox**: Preferences › Advanced holds the deep tweaks, but common choices (Load Lock, Quantize, Instant Doubles,
  Slip) are buttons in the deck's header too, so they are found where they are used.
- **Serato**: DJ Preferences is one short page of plain-English switches ("Lock playing deck", "Instant doubles",
  "Play from start"). Easy to read, though too short for power users.
- **Traktor**: very detailed but split into 20+ tabs, so things are hard to find. The lesson: deep options need search.
- **VDJ**: the flat searchable list, **Show modified**, the ⊗ reset per row and the description line at the bottom are the
  good parts. Internal names (`autoBPMMatch`) as the only label, and state mixed in with preferences, are the bad parts.

Taken together, for openDJ:

1. **Settings in context.** Every layer-2 choice that affects a deck is also on that control's right-click menu (as SYNC's
   quantize popover already is). Settings is where you find it, the control is where you use it.
2. **Plain names first, key second.** Advanced rows read "Echo tails ring out after the fader closes" with the stable key
   (`fx_post_fader`) shown small and grey, so forum posts and docs can name it exactly.
3. **Search finds by meaning.** "pitch" finds tempo, "PFL" finds headphones cue, "hamster" finds reverse crossfader.
   Each row carries a few search words.
4. **Show modified and Reset**, on every page and in Advanced, as in VDJ.
5. **One home per option.** A layer-2 choice also appears in Advanced (same row, same reset), so "Show modified" is
   the complete picture of how your openDJ differs from the defaults. That list is also exactly what a profile saves.

## The map

Layer: **1** = no setting, **2** = Settings page, **3** = Advanced, **–** = not in openDJ. **Has** = openDJ already has it (v0.4.5).

## Decisions (Seba, 2026-10-31)

- Match key on load stays at ±1 by default.
- Effect tails default to post-fader: they ring out after the fader closes.
- Planned for v0.5.
