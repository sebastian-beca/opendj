## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Store sources
Bandcamp SHALL search in the app and list results with price and format where the store shows them; choosing Buy SHALL open the item's page in the browser. Shopping SHALL offer other stores' own search pages filled with the search. Each store source SHALL be switched on and off in Settings › Sources and SHALL be hidden on a fresh install. openDJ SHALL never take payment, and store links SHALL carry no affiliate or referral tags.

### Requirement: Buy any track without a file
Buy… SHALL be offered on any track row that has no collection match (streaming lists, list placeholders from imports, Up Next and Wanted) and SHALL open the Buy sheet with the same store ranking as Buy from Wanted. A purchase started outside Wanted SHALL add the track to Wanted as being bought.

#### Scenario: From a Spotify playlist

### Requirement: Cross-links
Store track pages SHALL be found by ISRC through MusicBrainz, then Odesli, then each store's own lookup, and SHALL fall back to the store's search page. Prices SHALL be shown where a lookup gives one.

#### Scenario: Found through Odesli
- **WHEN** MusicBrainz has no Bandcamp link for a track and Odesli has one
- **THEN** the Buy sheet opens the Bandcamp track page, not a search

### Requirement: Match to Wanted
An Inbox track that arrived without matching a Wanted row SHALL offer Match to Wanted…, listing Wanted rows by artist and title similarity; picking one SHALL remove it from Wanted.

#### Scenario: Matched by hand
- **WHEN** a purchase arrives with different title spelling and the DJ picks its Wanted row
- **THEN** the row leaves Wanted and the track stays in Inbox

### Requirement: Artist-direct store add-ons

- **THEN** Mirlo is offered before Beatport

### Requirement: Beatport cart
