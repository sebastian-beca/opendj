The chosen pack SHALL be kept across restarts.

### Requirement: Own samples
An audio file (WAV, AIFF, FLAC, MP3, M4A or OGG, up to 60 seconds) SHALL be loadable onto a pad by dropping it from the file manager or the track list, or with Load file…. A pad SHALL be renamable, and Reset to pack sample SHALL bring back the pack's own sample, name, level and mode. Loading SHALL NOT interrupt playback, and a file that can't be read SHALL leave the pad as it was and say why.

#### Scenario: Drop a file on a pad

### Requirement: Pad level and play mode
Each pad SHALL have a level from silent to +6 dB (0 dB by default), set with a small knob on the pad in edit mode, and a play mode: One shot (plays to the end; pressing again restarts), Hold (plays while held), On/Off (pressing again stops) or Loop (repeats until pressed again). Shift + pad SHALL stop a playing sample. Level, name, sample and mode SHALL be saved per pack in settings, without changing the pack's files.

### Requirement: Record a sample
