## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Your layouts
openDJ SHALL keep the DJ's layouts as an ordered list (`layouts`), at first Player, 2-Deck, 2-Deck Pro and 4-Deck. The layout menu at the top left SHALL list only these, in this order. The layout in use SHALL always be in the list. Layouts added to openDJ later SHALL NOT join the list by themselves.

### Requirement: Settings › Layouts
Settings SHALL have a Layouts page: Your layouts (each with a preview, up and down to reorder, and − to take it out) and More layouts (a card with a preview, a line on what it is for and + Add for each layout not in the list). Clicking a row or card SHALL switch to that layout. A cog at the top right of the layout menu SHALL open this page.

#### Scenario: Adding a layout
- **WHEN** the DJ presses + Add on 4-Deck under More layouts
