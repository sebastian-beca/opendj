# openDJ roadmap

The open OpenSpec changes in `openspec/changes/`, in the order they are planned (within a release, in build order). Each change's `proposal.md` says why, and its `specs/` say what will be true when it's done. When a change ships, archive it (`openspec archive <name>`) so `openspec/specs/` takes its requirements.

This file only says which release each change is planned for, and in what order. How far a change has got is not written here: tick its steps in `changes/<name>/tasks.md` and run `scripts/roadmap.py` (or `scripts/roadmap.py v0.6`) to see every change as not started, in progress or built. The notes after a link say what the change is and why it sits in that release, not its progress, so a PR that moves a change forward doesn't edit this file. `scripts/roadmap.py --check` (run in CI) makes sure every change folder is listed, and listed once per release.

Released so far: v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 (2026-10-15, 2026-10-20) and v0.3.0 (prepared 2026-10-21: four decks, mic and aux inputs, stages, Collection Health, in-app updates, signed macOS app) and v0.3.5 (prepared 2026-10-28: sampler with sample packs, phrases, mini waveforms, key lock and fuzzy keymixing, FLX4 pad modes, Controller Editor; from the v0.4 list below, add-analyze-track, add-key-lock-and-fuzzy-keymixing and add-controller-viewer shipped early, the rest stay for v0.4) and v0.4.0 (prepared 2026-10-28: duplicate merging and quarantine, name clean-up and genre merging, online tag lookup, sets and crates, sync deck controls, FX bar, compact 2-Deck layout, Windows preview, experimental Pioneer USB export; add-cloud-storage-care, add-browser-preview-player and add-more-audio-decoders move on) and v0.4.5 (prepared 2026-10-30, early from the v0.5 list: rekordbox and Mixxx library imports, controller mapping import/export, own mappings, Map mode and Quick map, DDJ-FLX6 mapping, first-run guided tour, Beat This! beatgrids with grid lock, streaming browse for Spotify, TIDAL, Apple Music, SoundCloud and Mixcloud, Albums and Mixed Sets folders, "collection" naming) and v0.4.6 (prepared 2026-10-31: headphone cue follows the loaded deck, smaller screens, metronome and Bar 1 here for grids, Automix crossfader lock, kept streaming playlists, Spotify Download Track) and v0.4.7 (prepared 2026-11-02: plugin effects and instruments (CLAP, VST3, AU), phone remote for Automix, FX engine upgrade with six new effects, Traktor Kontrol HID controllers, XDJ-RX3 and Numark V7 mappings, beat counter, slip per trick, Automix Order menu, audio health meter, .deb and .rpm packages, and from add-live-broadcast the loudness meter, true-peak limiter and Icecast/Shoutcast streaming) and v0.5.0 (prepared 2026-11-04: Traktor import, tag groups, batch editing, Plex, Navidrome and Jellyfin sources, Settings › Sources, Collection Health dashboard with five areas, Player layout, Groove Box, Instruments rail, advanced tutorials, Mixcloud export, Xone K2 mapping, Settings › Plugins with plugin windows, one accent colour, M3U8 export and M3U/PLS/XSPF import, the now-playing feed and OBS overlay; add-prep-layout ships hidden for v0.6, and the v0.5 changes not started move to v0.6) and v0.5.1 (prepared 2026-11-06, early from the v0.6 list: deck outputs and external mixer mode, MIDI clock out and in, OSC control, rekordbox XML export, app menus, backups, buy from Wanted, SLICER and FREEZE, Stem FX, quicker scratching, track end warning, imported lists and nested list moves, Intro over outro Automix on better phrase detection, Groove Box with eight tracks and pad controllers; the rest of v0.6 stays for v0.6) and v0.6.0 (prepared 2026-11-09: reworked instruments with presets, scale, chord and arpeggiator, live deck waveforms, the looper, Groove Box fills and Remix, MIDI device routing, the filter bar, Player Home, artist and album pages, Keep going, system media controls, scrobbling, lyrics on the waveforms, the karaoke screen and Whisper word timing, from the v0.7 list early; the v0.6 changes not started move to v0.7). `openspec/specs/` describes the app as of v0.3.0 plus PR #56.
